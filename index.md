# FleetOptimiser OS2 Documentation

Welcome to the main documentation repo of FleetOptimiser OS2. The most important stuff in order to get up and running will be explained here.
There are two main ways of running FleetOptimiser; as development with one or more services running as containers or as production where all services will be containerised.

### Production
How to run FleetOptimiser in production will be explained on this dedicated [Production] page.

### Developing
Running FleetOptimiser in developer mode is easy and can be done in multiple ways. The most common will be explained on the [Developing] page.

### Extractors
In addition to the description of how to run FleetOptimiser, we also offer extraction modules to fleet management systems that loads and aggregate driving-data. 
For more details go the [Extractors] page.

[Production]: production.md
